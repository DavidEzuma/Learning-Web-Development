# Learning-Web-Development
The contents of this repository are dedicated to David Ezuma learning the core contents of web development. This will consist of mastering the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript language, as well as possibly learning database and formula expression languages. I leave all of these things, and the stress that may come, into the hands of Adonai. :)
